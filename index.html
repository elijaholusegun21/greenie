          <p>Trees are one of the greatest gift given to us by nature. Trees have lots of importance
              to humans and the world at large and we can not over emphasize how blessed we are to
              have this nature's gift. Trees are very essential starting from its contribution to 
              our environment by providing oxygen, improving air quality, climate amelioration, 
              conserving water, preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. Trees, shrubs and turf
              also filter air by removing dust and absorbing other pollutants like carbon monoxide,
              sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
              One of the most essential importance of trees is its ability to provide oxygen and 
              limit carbon in the atmosphere. According to research and studies, “One acre of forest
              absorbs six tons of carbon dioxide and puts out four tons of oxygen. This is enough to
              meet the annual needs of 18 people.” At <span> <b>GREENIE</b> </span> we educate and enlighten 
              people about the importance of trees as they help absorb and sink the carbon that would
              otherwise contribute to global heating. We inspire people to <span> <b> PLANT, NUTURE and 
              CELEBRATE </b> </span> 
              trees.

      <p>Trees have supported and sustained life throughout our existence. They have a wide
          variety of practical and commercial uses. Did you know the bark of some trees can
          be made into cork and is a source of chemicals and medicines? Quinine and aspirin
          are both made from bark extracts. The inner bark of some trees contains latex, the
          main ingredient of rubber. How many more uses can you name?
          That’s why the more trees are out there, the better. Unfortunately, as areas of 
          forest the size of a football pitch are being lost every minute, we’re yet to get
          to the right track when it comes to forest protection and management. It is so 
          important that things go right. Support <b>GREENIE</b> by making donations today.
          Let's get it right this time!.
